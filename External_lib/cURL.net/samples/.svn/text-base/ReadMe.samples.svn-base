libcurl.NET 1.3 Samples (c) 2004. 2005 Jeff Phillips jeff@jeffp.net

These are trivial examples to demonstrate the basic functionality
of libcurl.NET.

** BEGIN IMPORTANT NOTE **

Unless you place the LibCurlNet bin directory (the one that
contains LibCurlNet.dll) into your PATH, you'll need to run
these samples from the bin directory. This is because these
are private assemblies. You are, however, free to modify
LibCurlNet as you wish to make it a public assembly accessible
from the GAC.

** END IMPORTANT NOTE **

The samples include:

-- BookPost: A simple POST to look up Topology books at amazon.com.

-- EasyGet: Retrieve a web page and echo it to the console.

-- FileUpload: Demonstrate RFC 1867 multi-part upload.

-- Headers: Dump headers, demonstrating HEADERFUNCTION delegate.

-- InfoDemo: Dump CURLINFO data received after a download.

-- MultiDemo: Retrieve two URLs using the Multi interface.

-- ShareDemo: Retrieve two URLs in separate threads, with synchronized
              access to DNS and cookie data via the Share object.

-- SSLGet: Retrive an https web page. Try https://sourceforge.net.

-- Upload: Upload a file to an FTP site.

-- VersionData: Dump internal cURL version data.
