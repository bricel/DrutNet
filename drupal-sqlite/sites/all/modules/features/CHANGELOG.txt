features DRUPAL-6--1-BETA4

to production sites.

features DRUPAL-6--1-BETA3
--------------------------
This release of Features contains several key changes - if you are using
Features in production you should be cautious of upgrading without testing.

Previous releases of features contained an error in integration with the
node module - the module key of hook_node_info() should now be features
rather than node. Features will do this update for you automatically if
you use drush features update or update your feature through the UI.
You will still need to run features_update_6100() from update.php to
update the node type entries in your database. For more information
about this issue see http://drupal.org/node/521606.

- Using correct API identifier for CTools integration.
- Allowing modules that implement hook_system_info_alter() to modify the
  features info cache as well.
- #532256 by flobruit: Use proper ctools API functions for schema retrieval and
  object export.
- #551490 by fago, Allow renaming of components.
- Fixing bad FormAPI key ['#redirect']
- #521606 by mig5, q0rban: Correct hook_node_info() 'module' attribute to remove
  feature node types when feature is disabled.
- Fix for node type export check which should now include 'features' as an
  acceptable module for node type exports.
